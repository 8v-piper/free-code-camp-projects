                    In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page. As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the different views that you have defined.
                    To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular Router. The Router enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.
                    To explore a sample app featuring the router's primary features, see the <a href="https://angular.io/generated/live-examples/router/stackblitz.html">live example</a>  / <a href="https://angular.io/generated/zips/router/router.zip">download example.</a>

                <p>
                    This topic describes how to implement many of the common tasks associated with adding the Angular router to your application.
                </p>
                <h3>Generate an application with routing enabled</h3>
                <p>
                    The following command uses the Angular CLI to generate a basic Angular application with an application routing module, called AppRoutingModule, which is an NgModule where you can configure your routes. The application name in the following example is routing-app.
                </p>
                
                <div class="code">
                    <code>ng new routing-app --routing</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When generating a new application, the CLI prompts you to select CSS or a CSS preprocessor. For this example, accept the default of CSS.
                </p>
                <h3>Adding components for routing</h3>
                <p>
                    To use the Angular router, an application needs to have at least two components so that it can navigate from one to the other. To create a component using the CLI, enter the following at the command line where first is the name of your component:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>ng generate component first</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Repeat this step for a second component but give it a different name. Here, the new name is second.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>ng generate component second</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The CLI automatically appends <code>Component</code>, so if you were to write <code>first-component</code>, your component would be <code>FirstComponentComponent</code>
                </p>
                <div class="helpful-alert">
                <p>
                    This guide works with a CLI-generated Angular application. If you are working manually, make sure that you have <code><base href="/"></code> in the <code><head></code> of your index.html file. This assumes that the app folder is the application root, and uses <code>"/"</code>.
                </p>
                </div>
                    <h3>Importing your new components</h3>
                    <p>
                       To use your new components, import them into AppRoutingModule at the top of the file, as follows:
                    </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        AppRoutingModule (excerpt) <br>
                        import { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';<br>
                        import { SecondComponent } from './second/second.component';
                    </code>
                </div>
            </section>   
            <section class="main-section" id="Defining_a_basic_route">
                <header><h3>Defining a basic route</h3></header>
                <p>
                    There are three fundamental building blocks to creating a route.
                    Import the AppRoutingModule into AppModule and add it to the imports array.
                    The Angular CLI performs this step for you. However, if you are creating an application manually or working with an existing, non-CLI application, verify that the imports and configuration are correct. The following is the default AppModule using the CLI with the --routing flag.
                </p>
    
                <h3>CLI AppModule with routing</h3>
                <code class="code">
                    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';<br>
                    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';<br>
                    import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module'; // CLI imports AppRoutingModule<br>
                    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';<br>

                    @NgModule({<br>
                        declarations: [
                            AppComponent
                        ],<br>
                        imports: [
                            BrowserModule,
                            AppRoutingModule // CLI adds AppRoutingModule to the AppModule's imports array
                        ],<br>
                        providers: [],<br>
                        bootstrap: [AppComponent]
                        })<br>
                        export class AppModule { }

                        <li> 
                            Define your routes in your Routes array.<br>
                            The Angular CLI performs this step automatically. The CLI also sets up a Routes array for your routes and configures the imports and exports arrays for @NgModule().
                            <h4>CLI application routing module</h4>                    
                            <code class="code">
                                import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
                                import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router'; // CLI imports router
                
                                const routes: Routes = []; // sets up routes constant where you define your routes
                
                                // configures NgModule imports and exports
                                @NgModule({
                                imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
                                exports: [RouterModule]
                                })
                                export class AppRoutingModule { }
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Import RouterModule and Routes into your routing module.<br>
                            Each route in this array is a JavaScript object that contains two properties. The first property, path, defines the URL path for the route. The second property, component, defines the component Angular should use for the corresponding path.<br>
                            <h4>AppRoutingModule (excerpt)</h4>
                            <code class="code">

                                { path: 'second-component', component: SecondComponent },<br>
                                ];

                        <li>
                            Add your routes to your application.
                            Now that you have defined your routes, you can add them to your application. First, add links to the two components. Assign the anchor tag that you want to add the route to the routerLink attribute. Set the value of the attribute to the component to show when a user clicks on each link. Next, update your component template to include <router-outlet>. This element informs Angular to update the application view with the component for the selected route.

                <p>
                    The order of routes is important because the Router uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes. List routes with a static path first, followed by an empty path route, which matches the default route. The wildcard route comes last because it matches every URL and the Router selects it only if no other routes match first.

                    <p>
                        Often, as a user navigates your application, you want to pass information from one component to another. For example, consider an application that displays a shopping list of grocery items. Each item in the list has a unique id. To edit an item, users click an Edit button, which opens an EditGroceryItem component. You want that component to retrieve the id for the grocery item so it can display the right information to the user.
                        You can use a route to pass this type of information to your application components. To do so, you use the ActivatedRoute interface.
                        To get information from a route:
                    </p>

                                Import ActivatedRoute and ParamMap to your component.

                                These import statements add several important elements that your component needs. To learn more about each, see the following API pages:

                <p>
                    A well-functioning application should gracefully handle when users attempt to navigate to a part of your application that does not exist. To add this functionality to your application, you set up a wildcard route. The Angular router selects this route any time the requested URL doesn't match any router paths.
                    To set up a wildcard route, add the following code to your routes definition.
                </p>
                <code class="code">
                    AppRoutingModule (excerpt)
                    { path: '**', component:  }
                </code>
                <p>The two asterisks, **, indicate to Angular that this routes definition is a wildcard route. For the component property, you can define any component in your application. Common choices include an application-specific PageNotFoundComponent, which you can define to display a 404 page to your users; or a redirect to your application's main component. A wildcard route is the last route because it matches any URL. For more detail on why order matters for routes, see Route order.</p>
